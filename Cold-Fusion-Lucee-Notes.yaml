  - CFML to JavaByteCode to JVM
  - There are Two Context:
    - Server Context: available to all the Web(Domain) Contexts
    - Web(Domain)Context: a context for our app;
  - Variables:
    - assignment happen from right to left and not the opposite;
    - Line terminator for cold fusion is ';'
    - a = 1; b= 1.4; c =[1,2,3,4,5] array; d ={key="hello",today=now()} struct
    - CFML is case insensitive; a variable and A variable name is the same;
    - change variables type dynamically; a=1; a =1.23; a=[1,23,4]
    - how to write output to console, html or a file https://cfdocs.org/writedump
    - CaseSensitivity:
      - A is equal to a in CFML;
    - isDefined(): is it even present in the scope;
    - idNull(): is it even null or not;
    - Variable Types:
      - Arrays: [value,value,value,value]
      - Struct: {key:value,key:value}
      - Integer: 1
      - Float: 1.2
      - Boolean: false
      - String: "lol"
      - Query:
      - List: "asdf,sadfas,fasd,fasdf" (a string with delimiters assigned to a variable);
      - Date:
     - All the collection functions: https://cfdocs.org/member
  - Components:
    - there is support for static variables and functions ;
  - Properties:
    - member variables of a class;
  - Functions:
    - First Class functions : functions can be passed around like other data types;
  - Try/Catch/Finally:
    - try{}catch(any e){}finally{}
